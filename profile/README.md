## What is Furmark?

**Furmark** is a highly intensive **GPU stress test and benchmarking tool** used worldwide to evaluate the performance, stability, and thermal behavior of graphics cards. By rendering a complex furry donut in real-time using OpenGL, Furmark pushes your GPU to its maximum capacity, helping users identify overheating issues, artifacts, or instability caused by overclocking.

Furmark is widely used by gamers, overclockers, and hardware reviewers to:
- Test GPU cooling solutions.
- Monitor real-time temperature and performance metrics.
- Validate system stability under extreme conditions.
- Compare graphics card performance across different models.

Whether you're testing a new build, overclocking your GPU, or troubleshooting graphical issues, Furmark provides accurate and reliable results in an easy-to-use interface.
